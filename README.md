## Overview  
This is a multi-threaded chat server written in C++. The server enables clients to communicate with each other through private messages, group chats, and broadcast messages. The server handles user authentication, group management, and message routing using TCP sockets.  

---

## Instructions to Compile and Run the Server  

1. Use any Linux kernel for testing the code.  
2. Open the terminal and write the command **`make`**. This compiles both the client and the server.  
3. Now, in the terminal, type the command **`./server_grp`**. This starts the server.  
4. Now split the terminal and type the command **`./client_grp`** to run the client.  

---

## Features  

- **User Authentication**: Users are required to log in with a username and password stored in a `users.txt` file.  
- **Broadcast Messaging**: Clients can send messages to all connected users.  
- **Private Messaging**: Clients can send direct messages to specific users.  
- **Group Messaging**: Clients can create, join, leave, and message groups.  
- **Thread-Safe Multi-threading**: Each client connection is handled by a separate thread, ensuring concurrent communication.  
- **Error Handling**: Throws an error message when an invalid command is used.  

---

## Design Decisions  

### Multi-threading Model  
- The server creates a new thread for each client connection (`std::thread`).  
- This allows multiple clients to communicate simultaneously without blocking the server.  

### Data Synchronization  
- Since multiple threads access shared resources such as the client list and group mappings, `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` are used to prevent race conditions.  
- This ensures:  
  - **Thread Safety**: Only one thread modifies shared data at a time.  
  - **Consistency**: Prevents data corruption when multiple clients interact with the server simultaneously.  

---

## Group Membership Management  
- Standard commands are implemented to allow a client to create a group, join a group, send messages to group members, and leave a group.  
- Appropriate broadcast messages are added wherever required.  
- The implementation ensures that only active clients are part of a group.  
- The server iterates through all groups and removes disconnected clientsâ€™ sockets.  

---

## Handling Multiple Logins  
- If a user is already active (i.e., the socket is already allotted to a user), an error message is thrown when the same user tries to log in from a different terminal.  

---

## High-Level Overview of Important Functions  

### 1. Server Initialization (main function)  
- Loads user credentials from `users.txt` into an unordered map.  
- Creates a TCP socket using `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)`.  
- Binds the socket to port **12345**.  
- Listens for incoming client connections (`listen(server_socket, 10)`).  
- Accepts new client connections in a loop.  
- Creates a new thread to handle each client connection (`std::thread t(handle_client, client_socket)`).  

### 2. Client Handling (handle_client function)  
- Prompts the client for authentication credentials.  
- If valid, adds the username to a global client list (protected by a mutex).  
- A while-loop continuously listens for messages from the client to maintain real-time communication.  
- When a client disconnects, the server removes them from the global client list and any groups they were part of.

### 3. Message Processing (handleCommands function)  
#### Broadcast Messages (`/broadcast <message>`)  
- Sent to all connected users except the sender.  
- Implemented using `broadcastMessageToAllUsers()`, which iterates through the clients list and sends messages over the corresponding sockets.  

#### Private Messages (`/msg <username> <message>`)  
- Searches the global client list for the recipient.  
- Uses `privateMessageToUser()` to deliver the message.  
- If the recipient is offline, a notification is sent back to the sender.

#### Group Management  
- **Create Group** (`/create_group <groupname>`): Initializes a new group with the creator as the first member.  
- **Join Group** (`/join_group <groupname>`): Checks if the group exists and adds the user. A notification is sent to all members.  
- **Leave Group** (`/leave_group <groupname>`): Removes the user from the group. If the group becomes empty, it is deleted.  
- **Send Group Message** (`/group_msg <groupname> <message>`): Sends the message to all group members.

## Synchronization & Thread Safety  
- Since multiple clients can connect simultaneously, shared resources (client list and groups list) must be protected.  
- The server uses:  
  - **Mutex Locks (`std::mutex`)** to prevent data races.  
  - **Lock Guards (`std::lock_guard<std::mutex>`)** to automatically release locks when the function scope exits.  

---

## Testing  
- For stress testing, we ran a Python script to simulate multiple client login requests.  

---

## Challenges Faced and Solutions  

- **Choosing the right libraries** for different purposes on Linux took time.  
- **Multi-threading** was new to our team.  
  - We started by looking at the given hint in the assignment, understanding `lock_guard` and `mutex`.  
  - After reading online resources, we successfully implemented thread synchronization.

## Restrictions in the Server  

| Feature | Limitation |
|---------|-----------|
| Maximum Clients (Simultaneous) | ~28 users (no delay) |
| Maximum Clients (With 0.01s delay) | >5000 users (without broadcast), ~184 users (with broadcast) |
| Maximum Message Length | 1024 bytes (including command length) |
| Maximum Groups | Over 2,000,000 (depends on `unordered_map` memory limit) |
| Maximum Members per Group | At least 10,000 (can reach ~1,000,000 based on `unordered_set<int>`) |

- **Multiple login checking increases complexity**, reducing concurrent connections.  
- **Broadcasting join/leave messages** adds load on the server.
